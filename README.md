**Status:** Completed 

## 🧭 Objective
Cloning a repo, writing markdown, taking screenshot proof, and pushing to GitHub.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* Git Bash
* Git
* GitHub
* Windows 11 Pro

## 🔍 Key Findings
**Version Control Workflow:** Successfully cloned a remote GitHub repository and established a local working directory using Git Bash.
**Structured Documentation:** Created a professional engineering log entry using Markdown (.md) formatting.
**Evidence-Based Reporting:** Captured and embedded terminal output as proof of execution within the documentation.
**Cloud Publishing:** Successfully staged, committed, and pushed changes to a remote GitHub repository.

## 💡 Lessons Learned
This lab helped me understand that Git is more than just pushing files to GitHub, it’s about building a traceable workflow. Every commit goes on record, which is important in an enterprise environment.
Creating an engineering log helps you stay organized and document technical work clearly.
